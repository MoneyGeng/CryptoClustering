# CryptoClustering
Using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, the Crypto Clustering project endeavors to predict the impact of 24-hour or 7-day price changes on cryptocurrencies. The project also examines the effect of clustering on dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
